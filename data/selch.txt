You know, people ask me all the time—why go international? Why not just sell in the U.S. where it’s easy? And I tell them: the U.S. is a great market, but if you really want to build value, you go global. It’s not about ego or racking up frequent flyer miles. It’s about scale. It’s about taking a $50M company and making it worth $150M. You don’t get that kind of growth by selling the same thing to the same people. You grow by getting your products into the hands of people in São Paulo, Jakarta, Riyadh, and Istanbul.

Now sure, it’s not easy. But nothing worth doing ever is. If you don’t understand how to build trust across cultures, how to drive distributor mindshare, how to get the purchase order from someone who doesn't even speak your language? You’re leaving money on the table. And believe me—I’ve been doing this a long time—I’ve seen too many good companies screw this up. But done right? It’s magic. That’s what I teach. That’s what I live."
