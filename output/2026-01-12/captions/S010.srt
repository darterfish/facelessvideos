1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,147
Every quarter, your
company should reduce
its number of
priorities, not increase
them

2
00:00:05,147 --> 00:00:07,127
More priorities create
less progress

3
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:09,107
Focus is a growth
strategy

4
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:14,255
The moment your team is
trying to do everything,
execution starts to
collapse

5
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:19,007
Winning organizations
decide what not to do
and protect that
decision relentlessly

6
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:25,739
By prioritizing fewer
initiatives, you'll
avoid the pitfall of
mediocre results and
achieve more with less
effort
