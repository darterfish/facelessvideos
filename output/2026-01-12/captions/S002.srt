1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,503
If you have the right
people but they're
sitting in the wrong
seats, your organization
will feel stuck no
matter how hard everyone
works

2
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:11,483
Talent alone doesn't
solve anything

3
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:12,275
Alignment does

4
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:19,403
When each person is
operating in their
strongest role, with
clear expectations and
authority, momentum
becomes almost automatic

5
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:20,987
Accountability is not
micromanagement

6
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:21,779
It's clarity

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,343
Every number on your
scorecard should have
one owner

8
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:29,303
Every priority should
have one person
responsible for the
result
