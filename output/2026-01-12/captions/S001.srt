1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
Most companies don't
fail because the idea
was bad

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,554
They fail because the
vision never gets
converted into
disciplined execution

3
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:09,820
Vision without traction
is just enthusiasm

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:18,130
What creates real growth
is the slow, sometimes
boring work of turning
that vision into weekly
priorities, clear
ownership, and
measurable outcomes

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,662
Companies that win are
not more inspired — they
are more consistent
