1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,655
Every quarter, your
company should reduce
its number of
priorities, not increase
them

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:06,446
More priorities create
less progress

3
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:08,237
Focus is a growth
strategy

4
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:12,893
The moment your team is
trying to do everything,
execution starts to
collapse

5
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:17,191
Winning organizations
decide what not to do
and protect that
decision relentlessly

6
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:23,279
By prioritizing fewer
initiatives, you'll
avoid the pitfall of
mediocre results and
achieve more with less
effort
