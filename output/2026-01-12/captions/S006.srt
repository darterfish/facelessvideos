1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,315
Every quarter, your
company should reduce
its number of
priorities, not increase
them

2
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:04,591
More priorities create
less progress

3
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:05,866
Focus is a growth
strategy

4
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:09,182
The moment your team is
trying to do everything,
execution starts to
collapse

5
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:12,242
Winning organizations
decide what not to do
and protect that
decision relentlessly

6
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:16,579
By prioritizing fewer
initiatives, you'll
avoid the pitfall of
mediocre results and
achieve more with less
effort
