00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,384
Most leadership teams
think they have meetings

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:05,791
But let's be honest,
what they actually have
are discussions

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:12,265
A real meeting produces
decisions, priorities,
and action items that
move the company forward
in the next seven days

4
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:18,738
If people leave your
weekly meeting without
knowing exactly what
they are responsible for
this week, the meeting
failed
