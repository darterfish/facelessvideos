1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,592
Every quarter, your
company should reduce
its number of
priorities, not increase
them

2
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:06,358
More priorities create
less progress

3
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:08,124
Focus is a growth
strategy

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:12,716
The moment your team is
trying to do everything,
execution starts to
collapse

5
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:16,955
Winning organizations
decide what not to do
and protect that
decision relentlessly

6
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:22,960
By prioritizing fewer
initiatives, you'll
avoid the pitfall of
mediocre results and
achieve more with less
effort
