1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,110
Every quarter, your
company should reduce
its number of
priorities, not increase
them

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,075
More priorities create
less progress

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,041
Focus is a growth
strategy

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:14,151
The moment your team is
trying to do everything,
execution starts to
collapse

5
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:18,869
Winning organizations
decide what not to do
and protect that
decision relentlessly

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,551
By prioritizing fewer
initiatives, you'll
avoid the pitfall of
mediocre results and
achieve more with less
effort
